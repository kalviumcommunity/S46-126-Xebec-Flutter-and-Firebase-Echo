# Research: Flutter–Firebase Mobile App Architecture

This research examines the foundational architecture of modern cross-platform mobile applications using Flutter for the frontend, Firebase as a backend-as-a-service, and Google Cloud for infrastructure support. Flutter enables a single codebase to deliver near-native performance across platforms through its widget-based, reactive UI system, while Dart provides strong typing, null safety, and efficient asynchronous programming. Firebase abstracts backend complexity by offering managed services such as authentication, real-time databases, storage, and serverless functions, allowing rapid development without manual infrastructure management. Together, this stack supports scalable, maintainable, and production-ready mobile applications with streamlined deployment and CI/CD workflows.
